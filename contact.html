			<p>My hours are flexible I will go anywhere and do what it takes to develop data driven decision making that leverages real information to make optimized decisions.

			As a Digital Analytics Professional I am in charge of delivering real time, big-data, web analytics to key marketing, merchandising, and operations managers. I am fluent in Google's web analytics tool-set. My business intelligence is often pointed to as evidence of either success or failure on part of the organization or of the organization's affiliate's. I can work on the fly and desperately enjoy the work of delivering relevant, concise, and accurate data to key decision makers. </p>

			As an integral part of the Energy Sourcing Department at Georgia-Pacific I served as an Energy Sourcing Analyst. I alone was charged with the task of modernized all things regarding natural gas contracts. I was in charge of requesting, authoring, negotiation, approval, amending, audits, reports, and renewals. I demanded excellence in my primary responsibilities: contract administration, contract life-cycle management, and total-cost-of-sourcing.
			</p>
		
			<br>
			<p>
			I also worked for Georgia-Pacific LLC in Atlanta, GA as a Supply Chain Analyst. I analyzed customer Cost to Serve Data and consulted with Customer Logistics Managers, Regional Team Leads, and Innovation Teams to deliver cost saving perspectives to key decision makers. I accomplished this by tracking metrics for products like Angel Soft, Sparkle, Brawny, and many other private label brands.</p>
